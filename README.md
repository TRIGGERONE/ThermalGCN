# ThermalGCN

ThermalGCN is a fast graph convolutional networks(GCN)-based method for thermal simulation of chiplet-based systems.

- Use global information (total power) as input,
- Apply the skip connection in graph convolution network,
- Integrate PNA network into the model,
- Use edge based attention network to represent the connection effect.

## Installation

ThermalGCN requires Pytorch and DGL to be installed as backend. 

## Instructions
- Random chiplet layout generation:
  
  cd ./dataset/
  
  python Generate.py

- Obtain dataset:

  create a folder named "data".

  python run.py to run hotspot and generate dataset which is stored into "./dataset/data".
  
  python data_preprocess.py to normalize the data.

- Training GCN:

  python GCNPNAGAT.py
